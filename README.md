 **Swiggy Sales & Customer Analytics Project**
 **Project Overview**

This project focuses on analyzing Swiggy food delivery data to extract meaningful business insights related to sales performance, customer behavior, and regional trends. Using Python, Pandas, and interactive visualizations, the project transforms raw transactional data into actionable KPIs and dashboards that help understand revenue patterns and customer preferences.

The analysis is performed using a Jupyter Notebook, with the dataset sourced from structured Excel files and insights summarized through charts and metrics

**Business Problem Statement**

Food delivery platforms like Swiggy generate large volumes of transactional data daily. However, without structured analysis, it becomes difficult to answer key business questions such as:

1. How are sales trending over time?

2. Which food category (Veg vs Non-Veg) drives more revenue?

3. Which states and cities contribute the highest sales?

4. How does customer satisfaction vary across time?

5. This project addresses these questions by defining clear KPIs and visual analytics aligned with business requirements.

**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**

The following KPIs were derived and analyzed as part of the Business Requirement Document (BRD):

Total Sales (₹): Overall revenue generated from food orders

Total Orders: Total number of food orders placed

Average Order Value (₹): Revenue generated per order

Average Rating: Overall customer satisfaction level

Ratings Count: Total number of customer reviews

**Analytical Visualizations & Insights**

To support decision-making, the following charts and summaries were created:

Monthly Sales Trend: Identifies revenue growth and seasonality patterns

Daily Sales Trend: Compares sales performance across weekdays

Veg vs Non-Veg Revenue Contribution: Evaluates food category preference

Total Sales by State: Highlights state-wise revenue distribution

Quarterly Performance Summary: Combines sales, ratings, and order volume

Top 5 Cities by Sales: Identifies major revenue-driving cities

Each visualization is designed to answer a specific business question clearly and intuitively.

**Tools & Technologies Used**

Python

Pandas & NumPy – Data cleaning and aggregation

Matplotlib & Plotly – Static and interactive visualizations

Jupyter Notebook – Analysis and documentation

Excel – Source dataset

**Dataset Description**
The dataset contains transactional-level food order information, including:

Order Date

City & State

Dish Name

Food Category (Veg / Non-Veg)

Price (INR)

Customer Ratings

**Key Outcomes**

Identified top-performing cities and states

Observed clear monthly and quarterly sales trends

Found Non-Veg items contributing a higher share of revenue

Highlighted weekend vs weekday sales behavior

Built a structured analytics pipeline suitable for real business dashboards

These KPIs provide a high-level snapshot of platform performance and customer engagement.

**Conclusion**

This project demonstrates a real-world data analytics workflow, starting from raw data ingestion 
to business-level insights and visual storytelling. It showcases practical skills in data cleaning, KPI design,
aggregation logic, and visualization, making it relevant for Data Analyst / Business Analyst Role
